It usually contains the latest things I've learnt or discovered. The goal is to keep you inspired and motivated on your journey to becoming a developer. </p><p>I sometimes talk about my struggles as a programmer. I often talk about side projects I'm working on. Most of my friends work in tech, so often I also capture some of my conversations with VCs, founders, CEOs on things like tech stack trends, insider tips and life hacks,</p><p>In addition, the tech world moves very fast and it's difficult to keep on top of all the new developments, tools and skills. So in every edition of the L.A.B. Report, you'll discover 3 things I read in that month. I read a lot, and I try to pick out the top three things I discovered on topics such as Design, Programming, Productivity, Startup Growth and more.</p><p>You can see a&nbsp;sample <a href="https://www.appbrewery.co/p/newsletter/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>&nbsp;and decide whether if this is something you would want to receive once a month.&nbsp;</p><p>Because it costs money to send out these emails, if you think this will be useful for you, and <strong><em>only</em></strong> if you <strong>really</strong>&nbsp;want it, then you can sign up over here:</p><p><a href="https://londonappbrewery.com/sendy/subscription?f=m7Xj2bDOCQnlJ27yezLEAtJi1mhUIxOaJcJGZYMLLX6wx5MZd0b2FunBI8dOomNt" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sign Up Link for Udemy Students</a></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Best Wishes,</p><p>Your instructor, Angela<br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
