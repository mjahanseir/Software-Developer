# 01- What is OOP

Object Orientated Programming is a paradigm centered around objects rather then functions.
Objects which can contain data and code:
- data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties)
- and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods)

Its is not a programming language or a tool.

One of the features of OOP is that an object's method can access or modify its own data fields. And objects can have relations with one another.

Most popular programming languages that support OOP are class-based, so objects are instances of classes, which also determine their types.
