# 07- Getting Help

To get help about git command we can type a command followed by the `--help` flag. For example `git config --help` will give us the help topics about the `config` command. Press `space` to go to the next page and `esc` to exit.
\
If we use the flag `-h` we will get a shorter summary of the help topics.
