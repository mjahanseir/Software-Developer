# 04- Using Git

## Ways to use Git

### Command-line

The command-line is the most common, and probably the fastest way to use Git. Most GUI tools have limitations.

Sometimes GUI tools might not be available. Ins case for example if we connect to a server remotely and do not have permission to install a GUI tool.

### Code Editors & IDEs

Most code editors these days have built-in GUI tools and extensions to use Git.
