# 12- Viewing Staged and Unstaged Changes

Before committing code it is a best practice to review your code. To do that we can use the `git diff` command.

## Comparing the **Staging Area**

To view changes in files that we have added to the **Staging Area** we run `git diff --staged`. This command will give us the following output:

````zsh
‚ùØ git diff --staged
diff --git a/02 Creating Snapshots/12- Viewing Staged and Unstaged Changes.md b/02 Creating Snapshots/12- Viewing Staged and Unstaged Changes.md

+## git diff command

+Before committing code it is a best practice to review your code. To do that we can use the `git diff` command.

+```zsh
+git diff --staged

\ No newline at end of file
````

In the first line we can see that the `diff` utility as called and with which arguments, what files we are comparing. The **`a/...`** is what we have in the last commit and **`b/...`** is what we currently have in the **Staging Area**.

```zsh
diff --git a/02 Creating Snapshots/12- Viewing Staged and Unstaged Changes.md b/02 Creating Snapshots/12- Viewing Staged and Unstaged Changes.md
```

After that we have a legend, changes in the old copy are marked with a red **`-`**, and changes to the new copy are marked with green **`+`**.

```zsh
--- a/02 Creating Snapshots/12- Viewing Staged and Unstaged Changes.md
+++ b/02 Creating Snapshots/12- Viewing Staged and Unstaged Changes.md
```

The legend is followed by a header, that tells us what parts of our file have been changed. The changes are split in chunks and there is a header for each chunk.

The **`-1,3`** referes to the old copy. It means starting from line one **`1`** three **`3`** lines have been extracted and shown here.

The **`+1,5`** referes to the new copy. It means starting from line one **`1`** five **`5`** lines have been extracted and shown here.

## Comparing the **Working Directory**

To compare what we have in the working directory with what we have in the **Staging Area** we run `git diff`.

The output follows the same concept as `git diff --staged`.
