# 06- Committing Best Practices

Our commits should not be to small neither to big. We do not want to commit every time we change a file, neither we want to wait until we implement a featured end to end before committing.

The all point of committing is to record checkpoint as we go.

**Commit often** when we believe the project or file is at a state we want to record.

For example if we are fixing a **Bug** than we find a **Typo** we should make separate commits. One for the **Bug** and another for the **Typo**.

## Wording

Most people like to use the present tense for commit messages. But other conventions can be used.

- PRESENT: Fix the bug
- PAST: Fixed the bug
