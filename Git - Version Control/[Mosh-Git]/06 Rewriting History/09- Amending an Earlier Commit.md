# 09- Amending an Earlier Commit

To amend an earlier commit we use interactive rebasing. With rebasing we can replay other commits on top of a commit. First we choose the commit we need to amend and pass it parent to the `rebase` command with the `-i` option, like `git rebase -i <commit>`.

We can modify one or more commits. Git will recreate each commit that goes through the rebase operation even if the are not edit.

![Rebasing](./images/09-01.png "Rebasing")

In the above image suppose we only changed commit `B`, Git will recreate `C` and `D` to point not the new `B` commit.

Rebasing is a destructive operation because it rewrites history.

The `-i` option means we are going to interact with the rebase operation, stop it, make changes, continue it or abort it.

This command will open de default editor with a script, listing all the commits we need to rebase, and instructions to perform the `rebase` operation. Just like the following example:

```zsh
pick 8f1440a Add a reference to Google Map SDK.
pick 098a4bc Render restaurants the map.
pick 0bf60fe Fix a typo.
pick dd8f07e Change the color of restaurant icons.
pick ba55176 Update terms of service and Google Map SDK version.
pick f820221 WIP
pick 65dbb96 .

# Rebase 70ef834..65dbb96 onto 70ef834 (7 commands)
#
# Commands:
# p, pick <commit> = use commit
# r, reword <commit> = use commit, but edit the commit message
# e, edit <commit> = use commit, but stop for amending
# s, squash <commit> = use commit, but meld into previous commit
# f, fixup <commit> = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
# x, exec <command> = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
# b, break = stop here (continue rebase later with 'git rebase --continue')
# d, drop <commit> = remove commit
# l, label <label> = label current HEAD with a name
# t, reset <label> = reset HEAD to a label
# m, merge [-C <commit> | -c <commit>] <label> [# <oneline>]
# .       create a merge commit using the original merge commit's
# .       message (or the oneline, if no original merge commit was
# .       specified). Use -c <commit> to reword the commit message.
#
# These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.
#
# If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
#
# However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.
#
```

After configuring the script the rebase operations starts.

```zsh
‚ùØ git rebase -i 8527033
Stopped at 8441b05...  Add a reference to Google Map SDK.
You can amend the commit now, with

  git commit --amend '-S'

Once you are satisfied with your changes, run

  git rebase --continue
```

Here we can make the necessary changes, and then amend the commit. when we are done we run `git rebase --continue`, to continue the operation.

To abort the rebase operation in any point use the `--abort` option. `git rebase --abort`.

In a rebase operation, a change introduced in a earlier commit will be carried on thought the history.
